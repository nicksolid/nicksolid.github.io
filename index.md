## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpeg">

Hi! I am Dickson, a Strategy & Operations Lead at Google. My role is to be an objective & trusted partner to the sales organization. 

I was previously a management consultant in the Strategic Operations practice of Kearney. I have also worked on the electrification of ABInBev's APAC truck fleet in Shanghai, on the emerging Digital Financial Services landscape in Southeast Asia with [Google](http://think.storage.googleapis.com/docs/future-of-southeast-asia-digital-financial-services.pdf) and with GrabPay. 

I graduated with my BA in Economics from the University of Chicago and my MBA from MIT Sloan School of Management.
